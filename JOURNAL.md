## 10/7/2025 - started to work on the project  

I did some research and learnt the basics required to work on this project, I made a smaller mini project to double check

This took me a bit of time since I'm new to building hardware but this gave me some confidence to overtake the split keyboard  

## 10/8/2025 - Followed the guide   

I followed the guide and got the parts down, but before I start doing the layout and routing I'm going to make some edits so  I can guide the keyboard towards the changes I want to make independent of the guide, I'll most likely add some more components.

 I did some research about the items I want to add (haptic feedback) and it's criminally confusing for me so this might take sometime
